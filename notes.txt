# Reason for this
- Just to mess around with postgres 17's feateures since version 18 just got released



1. Vectorized io
- In previous versions, each page which is read uses a pread() syscall of 8kb
- Now seqential reads are combined into fewever vectorized syscalls
- Basically the optimization done is instead of requesting 8kb for every read,
you can bundle them into a single request. As in imagine 5 concurent read operations
1: first 10 rows, 2: middle row, 3: last 6 rows... , instead of makig 5x syscalls, 
you make a single syscall requesting 5x8kb

-  In order to change configurations, open the postgresql.conf file
    SHOW config_file;
sudo nano /path/to/postgresql.conf
