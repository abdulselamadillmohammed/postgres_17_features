    The data transfers performed by readv() and writev() are atomic:

    intermingled with output from writes in other processes (but see 
    pipe(7) for an exception); analogously, readv() is guaranteed to read 
    a contiguous block of data from the file, regardless of read operations 
    performed in other threads or processes that have file descriptors 
    referring to the same open file description (see open(2)).
